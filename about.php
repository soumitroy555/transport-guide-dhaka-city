  <h1>User Manual</h1>
  <p>It’s a great trouble for a new comer in dhaka city to fnd the transport. There are lots of
vehicle out there in road and it’s too hard for him/her to fnd the public vehicle for
destination. As a result, s/he have to ask people for the vehicle services.</p>
<p>Here, idea is; in this project people can fnd the public transport details..</p>
<p>To get the service user don’t require any account. They will input Location & Destination,
as output they will see the public transport names, approximate cost and additional
advice/ suggestion. They also can see the route in google map.</p>
<p>User can open account as volunteer. Here the work for volunteer is to update the best
transports s/he knows, their costs & other details. Admin will approve volunteer’s
update.</p>
