<h2>User Manual</h2><br>
It’s a great trouble for a new comer in dhaka city to fnd the transport. There are lots of vehicle out there in road and it’s too hard for him/her to fnd the public vehicle for destination. As a result, s/he have to ask people for the vehicle services.
<br>
Here, idea is; in this project people can fnd the public transport details..
<br>
To get the service user don’t require any account. They will input Location & Destination, as output they will see the public transport names, approximate cost and additional advice/ suggestion. They also can see the route in google map.
<br>
User can open account as volunteer. Here the work for volunteer is to update the best transports s/he knows, their costs & other details. Admin will approve volunteer’s update.
